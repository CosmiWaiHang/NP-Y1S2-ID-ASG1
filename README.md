# Anime News & Review Website - NP ASG ID I
Ngee Ann Polytechnic - Interactive Development (ID) Assignment I

## Usage

The [GitHub Deployment Page](https://cosmiwaihang.github.io/NP-Y1S2-ID-ASG1/page/home/home.html) contains the link to the website.

This page has been tested in all major web browsers, with the best visual appears obtained in Microsoft Edge Version 96.0.1054.34 (Official build) (64-bit)

## !Important Major Updates

Initially, I planned to add data from JavaScript, but after consulting with Mr. Andy Ng, he suggested that the page be static and that what we learned in lessons 5 and 6 be used in ID Assignment II. As a result, I created a few new folders with the suffix char 'x', such as homex, reviewx, and wikix, to house all of the static pages.

When we visit the homepage, we must click on the "Cancel" button to access a static page.

## Objective

The main goal of this website is to promote anime culture and help users learn more about their favorite anime. Furthermore, this website is intended to be a resource for anyone looking for anime news, reviews, and recommendations, as well as anyone interested in learning more about a specific character from an anime series.

## Design Process

- Make sure that all, if not most, of the elements have a hover effect to show the user where their cursor is.
  - For example, when a user hovers their mouse over a specific element, the border should light up, and the border should be disabled when the user moves their mouse away from the element
  - Reduce the amount of time the user spends looking for the mouse cursor
- Sometimes we, as users, are unaware that the button is there for us to click, and most of times we ignore it.
  - As a result, I added the button effect to alert the user that this button can be clicked to perform a specific task.

## Feature/Function

In this website, we provided the following feature:

For home page:
